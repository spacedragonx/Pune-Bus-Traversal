🚍 Pune City Bus Route Navigator
This is a C++ based application that helps commuters find the shortest route and fare between two bus stops in Pune city. The system uses graph and heap data structures, along with classic algorithms like Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine optimal paths.

It also integrates a visual map to assist with intuitive navigation.

📌 Features
🔍 Search Bus Routes: Input a source and destination bus stop to get the best route.

📍 Shortest Path Calculation: Uses efficient graph algorithms to compute the shortest path.

💸 Fare Estimation: Calculates the fare based on the total distance traveled.

🗺️ Graphical Map Interface (optional enhancement): Visualize the route for better understanding and usability.

⚡ Efficient Implementation: Utilizes min-heaps and adjacency lists for optimized graph traversal.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: C++

Data Structures: Graphs (Adjacency List), Min Heap

Algorithms:

Dijkstra’s Algorithm (for shortest path and fare calculation)

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

🧩 How It Works
Graph Representation:

Each node represents a bus stop.

Each edge represents a direct route between two stops, with the weight being the distance in kilometers.

Shortest Route Algorithm:

The system runs Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest distance between the source and destination nodes.

Alternatively, BFS or DFS can be used for exploring or testing different paths.

Fare Calculation:

The fare is calculated based on the total distance of the shortest route.

You can customize fare logic (e.g., ₹5 per km or slabs).

Output:

Displays the shortest route (as a sequence of bus stops).

Shows the total distance and fare.

Optionally, displays the route on a graphical map.
